## 🌱 Why I Started This Started

> I hope that everyone that uses or contributes to this project learns something new.

I started this project to learn modern CSS and JS, but so far I have learned so much more...math, statistics, analysis. The list continues to grow.

After spending considerable time on the project, it also felt like something that I wanted to share, and hopefully learn from others who are willing to continute! 🤝
