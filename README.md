- Cross platform and cross browser compatible.
- Only uses JS and CSS - **supported by all modern browsers**.
- Easy implementation on static, or complex and dynamic websites.
- All chart elements are **fully customizable** and provide an array of user interactions.
- No external dependancies.
- Always **privacy** and **security** focused.

## üîí Security and Privacy

This project is built with a strong focus on security and privacy.

The codebase consists solely of JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files used to execute and render charts. These files are purely frontend assets and **do not** collect, track, or transmit any data‚Äîeither to the project server or to any third parties.

### Hosting and Delivery

You have the option to:

 - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Self-hosting is disabled until 11 April 2025 (Current implementations remain unaffected)** - **Self-host** the JavaScript and CSS files within your own infrastructure, or
 - **Link directly** to the files hosted on the project's official website.

If you choose to use the hosted version, all resources are served securely over **TLS 1.2 or higher**, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the connection between your site and the project server.

### No Data Collection

This project:

 - Does **not** use cookies
 - Does **not** include analytics
 - Does **not** make outbound requests or track usage

It is fully suitable for privacy-conscious environments, and can be safely embedded in systems with strict data handling policies.
