- Cross platform and cross browser compatible.
- Only uses JS and CSS - **supported by all modern browsers**.
- Easy implementation on static, or complex and dynamic websites.
- All chart elements are **fully customizable** and provide an array of user interactions.
- No external dependancies.
- Always **privacy** and **security** focused.
