- Cross platform and cross browser compatible.
- Only uses JS and CSS - **supported by all modern browsers**.
- Easy implementation on static, or complex and dynamic websites.
- All chart elements are **fully customizable** and provide an array of user interactions.
- No external dependancies.
- Always **privacy** and **security** focused.

 - **Link directly** to the files hosted on the project's official website.

If you choose to use the hosted version, all resources are served securely over **TLS 1.2 or higher**, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the connection between your site and the project server.

### No Data Collection

This project:

 - Does **not** use cookies
 - Does **not** include analytics
 - Does **not** make outbound requests or track usage

It is fully suitable for privacy-conscious environments, and can be safely embedded in systems with strict data handling policies.
